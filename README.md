repository for TRUST project

TRUST is a standalone training mode program/platform for ST in Windows based on Dammit's groundbreaking work, and recent versions benefitted heavily from Pau Oliva's training mode and Pasky's awesome HUD scripts.  TRUST stands for Training Regimen Under ST, although the ST can also stand for Supreme Teachers, as users are encouraged to share the scripts they make with it.  The goal of TRUST is to provide an accessible and easily customizable training mode that users can tailor to improve themselves, and test what is possible.
